  <p>Jordan is a sovereign Arab state in the Middle East. The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most populous city as well as the country's economic, political and cultural centre.

Major tourist attractions in Jordan include historical sites such as Petra (UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985 and one of New Seven Wonders of the World),
 the Jordan River, Mount Nebo, Madaba, numerous medieval mosques and churches, and unspoiled natural locations (such as Wadi Rum and Jordan's northern mountainous region). Jordan also provides tourists with opportunities to observe cultural and religious activities and traditions. Jordan also offers health tourism (especially focused in the Dead Sea area); educational tourism; hiking, snorkeling and scuba diving in Aqaba's coral reefs; pop-culture tourism; and shopping tourism in Jordan's cities.

In 2017, Jordan recorded more than 3.8 million tourists. In 2009, more than half of the approximate 4.8 million Arab tourism travelers, mainly from the GCC, said they plan to spend their holidays in Jordan.</p>
